  I am a Capricorn, so im big on achieving my goals and very family oriented. I have one son who is my world. I want to make sure that i show him
  that you can do/be whatever you want. I will do this by achieiving my goals. Right now, my main goal is finishing this course
  and becoming an expert at the topic of web development.

  Sometimes life comes at us fast and we're just trying to keep up. I feel like i got lost in just staying afloat and wasn't doing 
  what i really wanted to do with my life. It was time for a change. I literally had an epihpany that reminded me how i used to love developing 
  and didn't even know it. Back in high school, there was MySpace. I would edit codes to create web pages, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Boom,
  it was my sign on where i need to direct my attention to change my life by doing something that i love, and creating a new career that i will
  enjoy, so here i am.
